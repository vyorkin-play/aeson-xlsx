# aeson-xlsx

Abandoned and not finished.
I've realized that it is very specific to my needs so I've just implemented it as a part of my app.

Opinionated XLSX to JSON converter.

Why? Basically because I need to:

* support formula parsing
* understand and be able to add other features quickly

Inspired by [jsonxlsx](https://github.com/stla/jsonxlsx).

I'm not going to publish it on hackage.
